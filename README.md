# Airline Delay Cause Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict the causes of airline delays using a variety of regression models. The dataset used, `Airline_Delay_Cause.csv`, includes features related to airline and airport operations, and the target variable is the count of delays caused by late aircraft.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Load the Dataset

Update the file path in the script to point to Airline_Delay_Cause.csv.

Preprocess the Data

The script performs data cleaning, which includes handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.

Train and Evaluate Models

The script trains multiple regression models on the preprocessed data and evaluates their performance based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Median Absolute Error (MdSE).

Results
The performance of each model is evaluated and printed out, showing how well each model predicts the number of delays caused by late aircraft. Metrics used for evaluation include MAE, MSE, and MdSE.
